# Digital Identity Management Smart Contract
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8d559e2f-6ad6-4b33-a0c0-026a16cb517e)

## Vision

The Digital Identity Management smart contract provides a decentralized solution for managing digital identities on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows users to register and update their identities securely while ensuring that identity information is tamper-proof and immutable. This contract can be used to support various applications such as user authentication systems, credential verification, and more, enhancing privacy and security in digital interactions.

## Flowchart

Below is a high-level description of the flowchart for this contract:

1. **User Registration**
   - User calls `registerIdentity(username)`
   - Contract verifies that the username is non-empty and the user is not already registered
   - Contract registers the username for the user's address
   - Emits `IdentityRegistered` event

2. **User Identity Update**
   - User calls `updateIdentity(newUsername)`
   - Contract verifies that the new username is non-empty and the user is already registered
   - Contract updates the username for the user's address
   - Emits `IdentityUpdated` event

3. **Identity Retrieval**
   - Anyone can call `getIdentity(userAddress)`
   - Contract returns the username and registration status for the specified address

## Contract Address

To interact with the deployed contract, use the following contract address on the Ethereum network:

```
0xYourContractAddressHere
```

**Note:** Replace `0xYourContractAddressHere` with the actual deployed contract address.

## Future Scope

The Digital Identity Management smart contract can be enhanced with additional features, including but not limited to:

1. **Identity Verification:** Integration with off-chain systems to verify user identities and credentials.
2. **Role-Based Access:** Implement roles and permissions to restrict access to certain functionalities.
3. **Multi-Signature:** Add multi-signature functionality for critical operations to enhance security.
4. **Decentralized Identity Standards:** Integrate with decentralized identity standards (e.g., ERC-725) for improved interoperability.
5. **User Privacy:** Implement privacy-preserving mechanisms to protect user identity information.

## Contract Details

### Contract Name
`DigitalIdentityManager`

### Functions

- **registerIdentity**
  - **Input:** `string _username`
  - **Description:** Registers a new digital identity with the provided username.
  - **Events:** Emits `IdentityRegistered(address user, string username)`

- **updateIdentity**
  - **Input:** `string _newUsername`
  - **Description:** Updates the existing digital identity with a new username.
  - **Events:** Emits `IdentityUpdated(address user, string newUsername)`

- **getIdentity**
  - **Input:** `address _user`
  - **Output:** `string username, bool isRegistered`
  - **Description:** Retrieves the username and registration status for the specified address.

### Data Structures

- **Identity**
  - **username:** `string`
  - **isRegistered:** `bool`

### Events

- **IdentityRegistered:** Emitted when a new identity is successfully registered.
- **IdentityUpdated:** Emitted when an existing identity is updated.
